title: Installing Swift and flight-cli
description: Get a Swift toolchain and the flight command on your machine.

You need two things before you write a line of Flight: a Swift toolchain,
and the `flight` command itself.

## Swift

Flight targets Swift 6.3 or later, on Linux or macOS 15+. If you already
have `swift --version` printing 6.3 or newer, skip ahead.

If not, [Swiftly](https://www.swift.org/install/) is the fastest path on
either platform:

```bash
curl -O https://download.swift.org/swiftly/linux/swiftly-$(uname -m).tar.gz
tar zxf swiftly-$(uname -m).tar.gz
./swiftly init
swiftly install latest
```

Confirm it:

```bash
swift --version
# Swift version 6.3.x
```

## flight-cli

`flight` is not published as a binary yet, so you build it from source —
which, on a Swift project, is one command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swift-Flight/flight-cli.git
cd flight-cli
swift build -c release
cp .build/release/flight ~/.local/bin/
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`, then:

```bash
flight --help
```

If that prints a usage summary, you're set. Everything from here on is one
command away.

## Why build it yourself, for now

The templates `flight new` emits are embedded directly in the binary —
copied in at build time from the exact `templates/` directory this
tutorial's exercises are generated from. Building from source means the
`flight` on your machine and the `flight` this tutorial was written against
are, by construction, the same one. A packaged binary release is coming;
until it does, `swift build -c release` *is* the install step, not a
workaround for one.

**Next:** [flight new, and the tier/trait model](./02-flight-new)
