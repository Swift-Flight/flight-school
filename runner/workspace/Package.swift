// swift-tools-version: 6.3
// The snippet tier's prebuilt workspace (PLAN §3/§4): one dependency
// (Hangar), one executable target, built once at image-build time so
// `.build` is warm before any learner code ever runs. `Sources/exercise/
// main.swift` is the only file the runner ever overwrites — everything
// else here is fixed, which is what makes a warm rebuild ~2s instead of
// a cold one (~1.81s measured in the plan's own probe, imports Hangar +
// PostgresNIO, @Entity macros expanding).
