// A Flight application with a database: everything the skeleton has, plus
// entities, migrations, a repository, and CRUD routes over Postgres.
//
// `flight-data` arrives with `traits: ["Postgres"]`. Traits are how a package
// carries drivers without imposing them: naming Postgres resolves PostgresNIO
// and Hangar, and naming no trait at all would resolve neither — you would
// still get the in-memory cache and the data protocols.
