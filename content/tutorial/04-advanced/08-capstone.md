title: "Capstone: the live issue board"
description: Assembled from everything — identical to the benchmark app, conformance-tested from outside.
order: 8

Every earlier exercise touched one seam at a time. A real app needs them
touching each other: a join that only admits someone with real access to a
project, a socket write and an HTTP write landing on the exact same
subscribers, presence showing who's actually looking at the board right
now. This capstone is that app — a live issue tracker, one project per
board, built from nothing this tutorial hasn't already covered.

```swift
struct BoardChannel: Channel {
    let repo: Repo
    let broadcaster: ChannelBroadcaster
    let presence: any Presence

    func join(_ topic: String, socket: Socket) async -> JoinResult {
        guard let principal = socket.principal else { return .reject(.unauthenticated) }
        guard let key = Self.projectKey(from: topic),
              let project = try? await repo.one(Project.where { $0.key == key })
        else { return .reject(JoinRejection("no_such_project")) }

        await presence.track(topic: topic, key: principal.subject,
                              payload: ["displayName": principal.name], socket: socket)
        await presence.sendState(topic: topic, to: socket)
        return .ok(initialState: ["key": .string(project.key), "name": .string(project.name)])
    }

    func handle(_ event: InboundEvent, socket: Socket) async -> HandleResult {
        guard event.event == "update_issue", let id = event.payload["id"]?.stringValue,
              let issueID = UUID(uuidString: id), let status = event.payload["status"]?.stringValue,
              let issue = try? await repo.one(Issue.where { $0.id == issueID })
        else { return .error(reason: "invalid_event") }

        // update, persist, then broadcast — the same ordering every
        // write-then-broadcast handler in this tutorial has used
        guard let updated = try? await repo.update(Changeset(original: issue).change(\.status, status))
        else { return .error(reason: "handler_error") }
        await broadcaster.broadcast(topic: event.topic, event: "issue_updated", payload: Self.wire(updated))
        return .reply(["ok": true])
    }
}
```

The HTTP side reaches the same topic through the same `ChannelBroadcaster`
this part's third exercise covered — a `POST /projects/:key/issues` and a
socket's own `update_issue` both end up broadcasting `issue_created` /
`issue_updated` to `project:<key>`, so a board sees a change exactly the
same way whichever door it came through. `join`'s authorization check, the
two-call presence integration, and the persist-then-broadcast ordering are
all exercises 1 through 5 of this part, applied together rather than in
isolation.

## Proving it from outside, not from inside

Every test this tutorial has shown so far — `TestClient`,
`ChannelWireClient`, `InMemoryChannelTransport` — runs *inside* the
process, against Flight's own test doubles. A capstone this size deserves
a different kind of proof: a plain client, in a different language,
speaking only the wire protocol, against a real running server over a
real socket. Something like:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:8090/socket?token=${token}`);
ws.send(JSON.stringify({ref: "1", topic: "project:BENCH", event: "flight:join", payload: {}}));
// assert: flight:reply with {key, name}, then flight:presence_state,
// before anything else arrives
```

That's "conformance-tested from outside": nothing about the check cares
that the server happens to be written in Swift, or that it's Flight
underneath rather than something hand-rolled — it asserts on the protocol
itself, the same envelope shape and reserved events this whole part has
been teaching, from a client with no special access to the server's
internals. A real POST to create an issue, checked against a socket
connected before the request was made, is the single most convincing test
this app can have: it proves the HTTP and WebSocket paths actually agree,
which is the whole point of routing both through one broadcaster.

## What building this twice actually showed

The first exercise of this part cited a measurement built exactly this
way: the same board, built once on Flight, once by hand against a lower-
level framework, both checked by the identical outside harness. The
verdict from that comparison is worth restating now that you've built
the Flight side yourself: the feature code — everything in `BoardChannel`
above — came out within single digits of line-count either way. The gap
was entirely in the roughly 300 lines of join/heartbeat/fan-out
infrastructure a hand-rolled version has to write, get concurrency-safe,
and maintain, that a Flight app never writes at all. Building this
capstone is, in a real sense, building only the half of that comparison
that was ever actually about your application.
