```swift
import FlightCore
import FlightWeb

@Controller
struct GreetingController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    func hello(_ context: RequestContext) -> String {
        "hello, flight"
    }
}
```

Create this as `Sources/App/Controllers/GreetingController.swift`, press
Run, and open the preview:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello
# hello, flight
```

No registration call, no route table entry, nothing added to `AppModule`.
`@Controller` marks the type; `@GetMapping` marks the method; the
registration plugin (from the previous exercise) finds both at build time
and generates the wiring. If you're looking for "where do I add my new
route," the answer is: you don't, past writing the method.

## What a handler can return

A `String` becomes a `text/plain` body with a `200`. For a domain type of
your own, declare `ResponseEncodable` alongside `Codable` and it becomes
JSON:

```swift
struct Greeting: Codable, ResponseEncodable {
    let message: String
}

@GetMapping("/hello-json")
func helloJSON(_ context: RequestContext) -> Greeting {
    Greeting(message: "hello, flight")
}
```

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello-json
# {"message":"hello, flight"}
```

`Codable` alone isn't enough, and the compiler says so rather than
silently serializing something unintended: *"requires that 'Greeting'
conform to 'ResponseEncodable'."* The conformance is empty in practice —
`ResponseEncodable` has a default implementation for anything `Encodable`,
so writing it is a declaration of intent ("this type is something I return
from a handler"), not work. `String`, `Data`, arrays, dictionaries, and
`Optional` already conform, which is why the first example needed nothing.

The response's `Content-Type` follows the return type — a `String` and a
`Codable` type don't need different handler shapes to get different
serialization, and you never construct a `Response` by hand unless you
need to (status codes and headers are next). Two more conveniences worth
knowing now: a handler returning `Void` answers `204`, and one returning a
`nil` optional answers `404`.

## `RequestContext`

Every handler method takes one as its first parameter (Flight resolves it
for you — it's never something you construct). It's your access point for
everything about the current request: path parameters, resolving
container components scoped to this request, and the logger. The next two
exercises are both about what you can pull out of it.
