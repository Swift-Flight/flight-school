// The full planned curriculum, transcribed from PLAN-flight-school.md §7.
//
// This is the site's source of truth for navigation and for distinguishing
// "not written yet" from "doesn't exist" — a slug listed here with no
// matching file under content/tutorial/<part>/ renders a "coming soon"
// placeholder (using this manifest's title/description) instead of a 404.
// That is deliberate: most of the curriculum is planned but not yet
// authored, and a broken link reads as a bug while a labeled placeholder
// reads as a map. See site/src/lib/server/content.ts for how a slug is
// resolved against real files.

	/// code is real and CI-verified — each exercise keeps an `app-b`
	/// solution built against a `flight new` template — but the reader runs
	/// it in their own project rather than in the page. `none` is prose
	/// with nothing to run.
	///
	/// `app`/`app+db` were execution tiers that got built and then removed;
	/// see STATUS.md for why. Nothing serves them, so nothing should claim
	/// them.
