"""Checks that content doesn't lie — modeled directly on flight-cli's
CI/verify-tutorial.sh, whose own comment explains why this class of check
exists: "the previous tutorial in this ecosystem drifted until seven of the
nine files it told you to create no longer existed. Nothing caught that,
because prose does not compile."

Two checks, both cheap (no build, no server):
  1. every relative markdown link inside content/ resolves to a real file
  2. every guides.ts / curriculum.ts manifest entry that IS written has a
     matching content/ file at the path the site's loader expects

This does not replace the heavier "build and run every solution" CI PLAN §6
calls for once exercises have runnable code attached — it is the fast,
first gate, catching broken links and drifted manifests in seconds.
