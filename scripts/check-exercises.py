"""Build — and where possible run — every exercise's real code.

This is the guarantee that survived dropping the app tier (see STATUS.md).
The interactive runner pool was expensive to serve; *compiling and running
the exercises* is cheap, and it was the compiling and running, not the
serving, that actually caught bugs: a `ResponseEncodable` error that had
been wrong in published prose since M0, an exercise whose payoff nothing
could observe, and a registration bug in flight-cli's own `basics`
template. None of those needed a browser.

Two tiers, two shapes:

* **snippet** — `content/tutorial/02-data/<slug>.swift` is one file that
  drops into the runner's prebuilt workspace as `Sources/exercise/main.swift`.
  Ones that call `makeRepo()` need a database; with `DATABASE_URL` set they
  are *run*, not merely built, because "it compiles" says nothing about
  whether the query was right.
* **app** — `content/tutorial/<part>/<slug>/` holds `meta.json` plus
  `app-a`/`app-b` diffs against a named `flight new` template (PLAN §6).
  `app-b` is the solution and must build. `app-a` is the starting state and
  is deliberately allowed not to — it is frequently an empty file.

Both tiers reuse one workspace across every exercise so dependencies
compile once. The workspace is reset from a pristine copy between
exercises (`.build` deliberately preserved), because exercises reuse type
names — three of them define `IssueController` — and a leftover file from
the previous one would either collide or, worse, silently satisfy a
reference the exercise under test should have failed on.
