import PackageDescription

// A Flight application, at its smallest: configuration, dependency injection,
// an HTTP server, and the operational endpoints. Nothing else — no database,
// no real-time layer, no cache.
//
// Two package dependencies carry all of it. `flight` is the framework and the
// layers above it; `flight-data` is persistence and caching, and is absent
// here because this tier does not persist anything yet.
